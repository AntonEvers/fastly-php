    "description": "A Dictionary is a VCL data table that stores key-value pairs accessible to VCL during request processing. New, empty dictionaries can be attached to a draft version of a service, which must be activated for the dictionary to be included in VCL. Once installed, a dictionary's items may be updated via API calls without having to activate a new version of the associated service configuration. To remove a dictionary, delete it on a draft version of a service (one that is not locked and not active). Once removed, activate the draft service version without the dictionary.",
